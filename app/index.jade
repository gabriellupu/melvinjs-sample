        Here you can define all the main regions of your app configurable in custom/modules/app/views/layout

        By default, a #content region is provided for the root view
        You can change this by adding / removing how many regions you want to use later using the application's
        rootView layout:

        ex: #content, #footer, #left-nav, etc.
        app.rootView.content.show(new MyContentView())
        app.rootView.footer.show(new MyFooter())

    #content
